# Fastify Crash Course - Simple CRUD API

This project is based on a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk-uVEVGxOA) by Brad Traversy. If you are not subscribed to Traversy Media you should consider doing so [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA).

This is an excellent introduction to Fastify.js. I learned a lot from the video. Thanks Brad!

Check out Fastify.js on their [home page](https://www.fastify.io/). There is a rich ecosystem of plugin for Fastify, both core and community plugins. The full list can be found [here](https://www.fastify.io/ecosystem/).
